# Task ID: 10
# Title: Cloudflare Worker runtime: normalization, KV exceptions, 410, and caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the Worker handling host normalization, path normalization, KV exact matches, 410 handling, and self-redirect guard; cache 301 responses at edge.
# Details:
- Normalize host to `www.watsoncreative.com`.
- Normalize path (lowercase, slashes, trailing slash, percent-decoding, diacritics) safely.
- Lookup KV map for exact exceptions; otherwise fallthrough to origin/Webflow.
- Guard against self-redirect; cache 301 via Cache API; log decision metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Worker unit tests and preview tests; ensure query preservation and caching works.
