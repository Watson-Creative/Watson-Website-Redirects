# Task ID: 4
# Title: Folder-level remap rules config and engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Define canonical folder remap rules that preserve leaf slug (e.g., `/portfolio%-items/(.*)` â†’ `/portfolio/%1`). Build application engine.
# Details:
- Create `config/folder-rules.json` for declarative patterns.
- Implement engine to apply rules to old paths and output candidates.
- Ensure Webflow-compatible escaping for Old path in CSV.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for applying rules; verify examples in PRD and edge cases; snapshot outputs.
