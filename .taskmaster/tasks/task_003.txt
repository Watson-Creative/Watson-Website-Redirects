# Task ID: 3
# Title: URL normalization utilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create reusable functions to normalize paths: lowercase, collapse duplicate slashes, normalize trailing slash (except root), safe percent-decoding, diacritics folding, and query preservation.
# Details:
- Provide pure functions for normalization variants used in pipeline and Worker.
- Add edge-case handling for encoded characters and spaces.
- Ensure deterministic behavior with tests.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive unit tests for `Ã©`, spaces, encoded characters, duplicate slashes, trailing slash, and query preservation.
