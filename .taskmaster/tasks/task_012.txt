# Task ID: 12
# Title: Localization safety and duplication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: When localization is enabled, duplicate folder rules and KV exceptions across locale prefixes without cross-locale mapping; reattach prefix post-map.
# Details:
- Parse hreflang sets and ensure no cross-locale matching.
- Config flag to enable/disable localization duplication.
- Extend exports and Worker handling for locale prefixes.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for locale duplication and isolation; integration check on sample hreflang data.
