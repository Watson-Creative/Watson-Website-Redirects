# Task ID: 6
# Title: Similarity-based exception proposal engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: For unmatched old paths, propose best targets by section-limited token similarity (e.g., hyphen-token Jaccard). Output proposals for human review.
# Details:
- Tokenize slugs by hyphen, compute similarity within section.
- Threshold to set `confidence` and `needs_review`.
- Do not use at runtime; only for KV exception proposals.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for scoring; verify threshold behavior; golden tests on sample pairs.
